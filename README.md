I have not change the program files yet, but I have completly updated the code to make this work as an xinput xbox gaming controller. This means the controller will work fully in most games, with rumble support, and real triggers, which are now linear. This also makes the game work with many devices like blue retro and blue tooth adapters as it will recognize the controller.

I also updated many other features, and added new features.

I updated how the controller steams packets, and making sure every button press is registered in games.

Just contact me if you want the updated hex file firmware if its not posted yet, you can easily flash the new firmware to your controller.
